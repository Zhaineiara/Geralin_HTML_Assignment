                                My best friend, Precious Daniella Mapa, is 21 and from Manila. She loves taking long naps and can sleep for hours without a care. When she's awake, she enjoys watching anime and getting lost in the stories and characters. She also loves playing Minecraft, where she gets to build and explore new worlds. It's a hobby that lets her be creative and have fun.

                                I'm Jenevive Ducabo Geralin, 21 years old from Samar. I love spending time with my friends, whether we’re just hanging out or doing something fun together. Staying active is important to me, so I enjoy physical activities like going for walks or sports, especially badminton. And of course, I really love food—especially when I get to eat with friends and family. Trying new dishes is always exciting too!

                        <p class="lead">
                            We met on the very first day of Grade 7, and I remember feeling excited to start a new school year and meet new people. I was the outgoing type, always eager to make friends and talk to everyone. Precious, on the other hand, was more reserved and a little shy. She wasn’t as open to new faces, and I could tell she didn’t want to talk much at first. I tried to start conversations with her, but she would always give short answers or just smile politely. I didn’t give up though—I kept trying to connect with her, even if it meant a few awkward moments here and there. 
                            Over time, we began to sit together in class and chat more often. At first, it wasn’t anything too deep—just casual talks here and there. But something clicked. Little by little, Precious started to open up more and share bits of her life. Sometimes we wouldn’t talk for days or even weeks, but whenever we did get the chance to catch up, it was as if no time had passed. We’d talk about everything—from school stuff to the small events in our lives. 
                            Even though we weren’t always hanging out every day, there was this unspoken understanding between us. Precious was always there for me when I needed someone, whether it was for advice, a laugh, or just to listen. She didn’t have to say much to make me feel better, and that’s when I realized how special our friendship was. We never officially decided to be best friends, but one day I just realized that we had been through so much together and that she was always there. Almost nine years have passed since then, and I’m grateful for every moment, because what started as a quiet connection turned into one of the best friendships I’ve ever had.
